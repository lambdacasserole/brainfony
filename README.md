Brainfony
=========

A super-serious web framework for dedicated developers.

![Brainfony](logo.png)

Brainfony represents a dedicated developer-oriented solution stack for today's modern teams of agile 
developers, using industry-recognised design patterns to deliver a PHP web framework designed for 
turbo-turnaround projects.

Just kidding.

Brainfony lets you code for the web in Brainfuck, a language designed by Urban Müller in 1993 when he
challenged himself to write the smallest compiler he could. The finished compiler in Müller's official
distribution weighed in at around 200 bytes. This complete disregard for language practicality led to 
one of the most bizzare and utterly useless programming languages ever to exist, [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). 

Sometimes, when I'm sitting in the office on a rainy day, gazing at our latest Symfony2 project and trying
to work out which of my bundles contains the controller that passes a variable into a Twig template that extends 
my base layout and is nested 12 levels deep, I'll find myself fantasising about coding in Brainfuck.
Fantasising about how it would be preferable to trying to wrestle with the unholy combination of the 
beautiful architectural ravioli that is Symfony2 and the weakly typed, undebuggable bug production engine 
that is PHP.

Now my fantasy is a reality.
